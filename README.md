## Agile Development

### MoSCoW Prioritization System

This project relies on agile methodology for its task management. This allows for more accurate estimation of time needed for successful task completion. You can access the kanban board used for this project [here](https://github.com/users/beratzorlu/projects/4/views/1)

Below are the labels used on GitHub to illustrate the various importance levels.

- Must Have: MVP feature (60% of user stories)
- Should Have: secondary importance (20% of user stories)
- Could Have: Tertiary importance (20% of stories)
- Won't Have: No longer in consideration

## Technical Design

### Data Model - Entity Relationship Diagram

[Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) was a highly beneficial resource that provided significant help in building a ERP to illustrate the various table relationships of data models present in the project.

![Data Relationship Diagram](#)

## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around user interaction and content sharing. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the application without adding much real value to the user experience overall. There are [records available](#future-features) as a part of this documentation that demonstrate the change in scope that took place moving further into development.

### Application Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the application as a whole.

## Future Features

This section documents the features that were taken out of consideration for the benefit of the completion of the minimum viable project. The central observation in this area is that the level of ambition that the project initially set out with does not match with the intellectual labour required to complete a significant sum of the features first assigned. Below, are user stories that were deemed no longer necessary. You can view the full kanbar board used for project planning [here](https://github.com/users/beratzorlu/projects/4/views/1).

That being said, these features remain relevant to the overall scope of the project and it would see them expand its functional capacity in the future if the situation allowed it.

| Label | Feature |
|---|---|
| Won't Have | As a Shopper, I can view available booking times for workshops so that I can decide if they fit my schedule. |
| Won't Have | As a Shopper, I can view a list of workshop classes so that I can easily inform myself of the experiences available on offer. |
| Won't Have | As a Shopper, I can view a page with all the relevant details of a workshop so that I can decide if it fits my interests. |
| Won't Have | As an Admin, I can add a workshop so that users can view new experiences.                                  |
| Won't Have | As an Admin, I can change the details of a workshop as needed so that they represent the most accurate and relevant information to the users. |

### Performance

The Lighthouse tests returned an overall acceptable result considering the scope and purpose of the project. Most notably, the performance value appears to be the more lacking area compared to the rest of the parameters available on Lighthouse. Information gathered from the testing process indicates that these scores are a result of Cloudinary slowing down the loading times of the images. In future projects, more effective cloud solutions such AWS will help prevent the recurrance of similar results.

### Heroku Deployment

This project utilizes the services available at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows users to build, deploy, and control applications in a cloud environment.

Disclaimer: To be able successfully replicate the Heroku deployment process, it is highly reccomended that users setup an account on the platform prior to following the steps provided below.

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard after log-in.
- Select navigate to the *Create new app* button from the dropdown menu and select it.
- Assign a unique name to your application.
- Navigate to the *region* dropdown menu and select the region closest to you from either EU or USA. 
- Select *Create App*.
- Navigate to your newly created application and select *Settings*. 
- Click *Reveal Config Vars*.
- Add first *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `CREDS`, copy and paste the data in your credentials file (ie. creds.json) into the value area.
- Add second *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- You need to add support to dependencies to be able to successfully deploy application, select *Add Buildpack*.
- The order in which you list your dependencies is critical, select `Python` as the first dependency.

### Library Information

- [The Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/): PyPI was critical in accessing libraries that added functionality to the project that otherwise would be impossible to feature in the end product.

- [Code Insitute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/): The theory available in the Code Institute curriculum has been central in successfully setting up and utilizing Google Cloud API services for this project.


### Theory

- [UCD Professional Academy](https://www.ucd.ie/professionalacademy/): I would like to thank UCD PA for their facilitator and masterclass sessions in partnership with Code Insitute. These have been invaluable in better understanding relevant theory and practice elements.
