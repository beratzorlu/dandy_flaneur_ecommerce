## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around user interaction and content sharing. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the application without adding much real value to the user experience overall. There are [records available](#future-features) as a part of this documentation that demonstrate the change in scope that took place moving further into development.

### Application Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the application as a whole.

## Future Features

This section documents the features that were taken out of consideration for the benefit of the completion of the minimum viable project. The central observation in this area is that the level of ambition that the project initially set out with does not match with the intellectual labour required to complete a significant sum of the features first assigned. Below, are user stories that were deemed no longer necessary. You can view the full kanbar board used for project planning [here](https://github.com/users/beratzorlu/projects/4/views/1).

That being said, these features remain relevant to the overall scope of the project and it would see them expand its functional capacity in the future if the situation allowed it.

### ElephantSQL Database Setup

This project utilizes [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To set up your own Postgres Database, follow these steps:

1. Sign up with your GitHub account on the ElephantSQL website.
2. Click on **Create New Instance** to create a new database.
3. Provide a name for your database (you can use the name of your project, e.g., example-name).
4. Choose the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
5. You can leave the **Tags** field blank.
6. Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to your location.
7. Once the database is created, click on its name to view the database URL and Password.

With these steps, you'll have your own PostgreSQL database set up and ready to use for your project.

### Stripe Integration

This project utilizes [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle ecommerce payments securely.

To connect your project with Stripe, follow these steps:

1. Create a Stripe account and log in to the Stripe dashboard.

2. In the dashboard, click to expand "Get your test API keys."

3. You'll find two keys:
   - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup measure in case users prematurely close the purchase order page during payment, we can implement Stripe Webhooks.

4. In the Stripe dashboard, navigate to **Developers** and select **Webhooks**.

5. Click on **Add Endpoint** and provide the following URL:
   - `https://retro-reboot.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`

6. Click **Receive all events** to ensure all relevant events are captured.

7. Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.

8. After adding the endpoint, you'll receive a new key:
   - `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Webhook) Key (starts with **wh**)

By integrating Stripe into your project, you can securely process payments and handle various payment-related events with ease. The Stripe API offers a robust set of features to manage transactions, handle card payments, and support multiple currencies, making it an excellent choice for handling ecommerce transactions in your application.

### Amazon AWS

This project uses [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) to store media and static files online because Heroku does not persist this type of data.

To connect your project to AWS, follow these steps after creating an AWS account and logging in. Make sure you are on the **AWS Management Console** page.

***S3 Bucket***

1. Search for **S3**.
2. Create a new bucket, give it a name (matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
3. Uncheck **Block all public access** and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).
4. From **Object Ownership**, ensure **ACLs enabled** and **Bucket owner preferred** are selected.
5. From the **Properties** tab, turn on static website hosting, and type `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
6. From the **Permissions** tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

```json
[
	{
		"AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],
		"AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
		"AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
		"ExposeHeaders": []
	}
]
```

7. Copy your ARN string.
8. From the Bucket Policy tab, select the Policy Generator link and use the following steps:
- Policy Type: S3 Bucket Policy
- Effect: Allow
- Principal: *
- Actions: GetObject
- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): paste-your-ARN-here
- Click Add Statement
- Click Generate Policy
- Copy the entire Policy and paste it into the Bucket Policy Editor

```json
{
	"Id": "Policy1234567890",
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
			"Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
			"Principal": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

9. Before you click "Save," add /* to the end of the Resource key in the Bucket Policy Editor (like above).
10. Click Save.
11. From the Access Control List (ACL) section, click "Edit" and enable List for Everyone (public access), and accept the warning box.

- If the edit button is disabled, change the Object Ownership section above to ACLs enabled (mentioned above).

***IAM (Identity and Access Management)***

1. Back on the AWS Services Menu, search for and open IAM (Identity and Access Management).
2. From User Groups, click Create New Group.
- Suggested Name: group-example-name (group + the project name)
3. Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the review policy page.
4. From User Groups, select your newly created group and go to the Permissions tab.
5. Open the Add Permissions dropdown and click Attach Policies.
6. Select the policy, then click Add Permissions at the bottom when finished.
7. From the JSON tab, select the Import Managed Policy link.
- Search for S3, select the AmazonS3FullAccess policy, and then Import.
- You'll need your ARN from the S3 Bucket copied again, which is pasted into the "Resources" key on the Policy.

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:*",
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
				"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

8. Click Review Policy.
9. Suggested Name: policy-example-name (policy + the project name)
10. Provide a description: "Access to S3 Bucket for example-name static files."
11. Click Create Policy.
12. From User Groups, click your "group-example-name".
13. Click Attach Policy.
14. Search for the policy you've just created ("policy-example-name") and select it, then Attach Policy.
15. From User Groups, click Add User.

- Suggested Name: exampleuser-project-name (user + the project name)

16. For "Select AWS Access Type," select Programmatic Access.
17. Select the group to add your new user to: group-example-name
20. Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the review user page.
21. Click Create User once done.
22. You should see a button to Download .csv, so click it to save a copy on your system.
- IMPORTANT: once you pass this page, you cannot come back to download it again, so do it immediately!
- This contains the user's Access key ID and Secret access key.
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = Access key ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = Secret access key

***Final AWS Setup***

1. If Heroku Config Vars has DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC still, this can be removed now so that AWS will handle the static files.
2. Back within S3, create a new folder called: media.
3. Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.
4. Under Manage Public Permissions, select Grant public read access to this object(s).
5. No further settings are required, so click Upload.

### Heroku Deployment

This project utilizes the services available at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows users to build, deploy, and control applications in a cloud environment.

Disclaimer: To be able successfully replicate the Heroku deployment process, it is highly reccomended that users setup an account on the platform prior to following the steps provided below.

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard after log-in.

- Assign a unique name to your application.
- Navigate to the *region* dropdown menu and select the region closest to you from either EU or USA. 
- Select *Create App*.
- Navigate to your newly created application and select *Settings*. 
- Click *Reveal Config Vars*.
- Add first *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `CREDS`, copy and paste the data in your credentials file (ie. creds.json) into the value area.
- Add second *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- You need to add support to dependencies to be able to successfully deploy application, select *Add Buildpack*.
- The order in which you list your dependencies is critical, select `Python` as the first dependency.
- From the same menu, select `Node.js` after you select `Python`. (You can drag the list items upwards and downwards to change their order if needed.)
- Scroll until you find your desired deployment method, select `Enable Automatic Deploy` to rebuild your project automatically every time you push a new commit. Select `Manual Deployment` to manually deploy from your desired branch on will.*

*If you have selected automatic deployment, your application will only deploy after your first push to the system.

After the completion of this process, Heroku needs two files further to deploy successfully. These are;
    - requirements.txt
    - Procfile

To install your project's requirements use: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 

If you have third party packages in your project the requirements file needs updated, use: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

To create your Procfile, use: `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal (CLI), connect to Heroku using this: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace <app_name> with your chosen name for your application without the angle-brackets)
- Input commands `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to GitHub sequentially.
- Finally, type `git push heroku main` in the terminal to connect to Github.

Alternatively, you can connect to your Github account by following the below steps on Heroku's platform.

- Navigate to your Heroku account dashboard.
- Find the relevant project and click on its icon.
- On the next page, navigate to the `Deploy` subsection.

The help I received from my mentor, Rohit Sharma, has been inspirational where he introduced me to alternative angles to issues that were seemingly difficult to overcome. Code Institute's Slack community was an invaluable resource for my project as well, especially during troubleshooting. Being a part of this community motivated me to keep going during times where I felt stuck. Lastly, the tutor support that Code Institute offers has been an invaluable asset for understand the more challenging aspects of building the code of my project.

## Closing Remarks

This project marks the end of my journey as a student at Code Instutite. Since the course has started, I have experienced a variety of hurdles that often felt daunting to deal with. Designing, developing and documenting a web application is an arduous but equally rewarding experience. This is exactly why I am looking forward to my career in this field. It is a career path filled with ups and downs, problems to solve, issues to fix, and content to learn. While the course was doubtless fruitful in learning full-stack web development, there is still much more to be learned. However, I can say with confidence that it is worth it to go through the struggle because, development essentially allows you to create something out of nothing. Somenthing you can truly call your own. I have come to find that there is a certain sense of accomplishment in building a project. Watching a mere idea come to life in the form of an application everyone can make use of is truly an inpirational experience.
