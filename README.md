## Agile Development

### MoSCoW Prioritization System

This project relies on agile methodology for its task management. This allows for more accurate estimation of time needed for successful task completion. You can access the kanban board used for this project [here](https://github.com/users/beratzorlu/projects/4/views/1)

Below are the labels used on GitHub to illustrate the various importance levels.

- Must Have: MVP feature (60% of user stories)
- Should Have: secondary importance (20% of user stories)
- Could Have: Tertiary importance (20% of stories)
- Won't Have: No longer in consideration

## Technical Design

### Data Model - Entity Relationship Diagram

[Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) was a highly beneficial resource that provided significant help in building a ERP to illustrate the various table relationships of data models present in the project.

![Data Relationship Diagram](docs/entity-relationship-diagram.png)

## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around user interaction and content sharing. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the application without adding much real value to the user experience overall. There are [records available](#future-features) as a part of this documentation that demonstrate the change in scope that took place moving further into development.

### Application Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the application as a whole.

## Future Features

This section documents the features that were taken out of consideration for the benefit of the completion of the minimum viable project. The central observation in this area is that the level of ambition that the project initially set out with does not match with the intellectual labour required to complete a significant sum of the features first assigned. Below, are user stories that were deemed no longer necessary. You can view the full kanbar board used for project planning [here](https://github.com/users/beratzorlu/projects/4/views/1).

That being said, these features remain relevant to the overall scope of the project and it would see them expand its functional capacity in the future if the situation allowed it.

### Performance

The Lighthouse tests returned an overall acceptable result considering the scope and purpose of the project. Most notably, the performance value appears to be the more lacking area compared to the rest of the parameters available on Lighthouse. Information gathered from the testing process indicates that these scores are a result of Cloudinary slowing down the loading times of the images. In future projects, more effective cloud solutions such AWS will help prevent the recurrance of similar results.

### Heroku Deployment

This project utilizes the services available at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows users to build, deploy, and control applications in a cloud environment.

Disclaimer: To be able successfully replicate the Heroku deployment process, it is highly reccomended that users setup an account on the platform prior to following the steps provided below.

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard after log-in.
- Select navigate to the *Create new app* button from the dropdown menu and select it.
- Assign a unique name to your application.
- Navigate to the *region* dropdown menu and select the region closest to you from either EU or USA. 
- Select *Create App*.
- Navigate to your newly created application and select *Settings*. 
- Click *Reveal Config Vars*.
- Add first *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `CREDS`, copy and paste the data in your credentials file (ie. creds.json) into the value area.
- Add second *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- You need to add support to dependencies to be able to successfully deploy application, select *Add Buildpack*.
- The order in which you list your dependencies is critical, select `Python` as the first dependency.
- From the same menu, select `Node.js` after you select `Python`. (You can drag the list items upwards and downwards to change their order if needed.)
- Scroll until you find your desired deployment method, select `Enable Automatic Deploy` to rebuild your project automatically every time you push a new commit. Select `Manual Deployment` to manually deploy from your desired branch on will.*

*If you have selected automatic deployment, your application will only deploy after your first push to the system.

After the completion of this process, Heroku needs two files further to deploy successfully. These are;
    - requirements.txt
    - Procfile

To install your project's requirements use: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 

If you have third party packages in your project the requirements file needs updated, use: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

To create your Procfile, use: `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal (CLI), connect to Heroku using this: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace <app_name> with your chosen name for your application without the angle-brackets)
- Input commands `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to GitHub sequentially.
- Finally, type `git push heroku main` in the terminal to connect to Github.

Alternatively, you can connect to your Github account by following the below steps on Heroku's platform.

- Navigate to your Heroku account dashboard.
- Find the relevant project and click on its icon.
- On the next page, navigate to the `Deploy` subsection.
- Scroll down until you find `Deployment method` and find `Use Github`.
- Finally, input your Github account credentials to complete the process.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to first and foremost thank my mentor, Rohit Sharma, for his dedication to helping me find direction in developing my projects and understand the fundamental considerations in growing as a software developer. Moreover, the tutor support available at Code Institute has been an excellent help in finding solutions to various issues I came across in the development process that I needed help. Lastly, the Slack community at Code Institute has been nothing less than inspirational. I commend their dedication to a constructive culture that strives to help future developers in their struggles towards their software development journey.

## Closing Remarks

In closing, the development process in its entirety has doubtless been a highly educative experience. This having been my first time using any kind of full-stack framework to build a web development project, I was introduced to many challenges which at times greatly impeded the development momentum. However, while this may be the case, overcoming the obstacles presented by such issues allowed for understanding how different elements of Django interacted with one another. It is possible to access these learning points through tutorial videos or blog posts. But, my experience shows that one does not truly learn the intricacies of Django until they experience and overcome them themselves. It is possible to argue that this experience isn't unique to the use of Django. The learning points obtained from experiencing and solving problems when using Django provide an opportunity to nurture a development strategy that can translate across many different forms of software development. Thus, if I would take away one key lesson from my experience with this project would be to start from smaller core functionality and slowly expand the project's functional capacity rather than the other way around. If not monitored correctly, the constant addition of tasks and ideas can lead to a long backlog of features that will never become a subject of consideration for the final project.
